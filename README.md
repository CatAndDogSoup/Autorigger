A pretty rough autorigger that I made a few months ago, in about two weeks.
Still missing components, and is far from production ready, but I wanted to get it up online, and get back into working on it

Currently I will be doing all my commits to the $Staging branch, so check there if $Master feels empty!


## USAGE
For each character rig you want to create, you'll want to make a new copy of `Template_Run_Script.py`, with the character name as the file name.

You can then edit this file to create all the individual pieces for that specific character, based on the build components in `Build_Components.py`

Finally you can run the individual character's build script from inside the rig file to build the rig
